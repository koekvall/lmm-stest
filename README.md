# Modified score test

This package implements a modified score test for the parameters in linear mixed effects models with independent random effects.

A brief introduction and an example is available at http://koekvall.github.io/docs/lmmstest/example.html

A paper motivating the proposed test statistic is forthcoming in the Annals of Statistics, with a preprint available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10236).
