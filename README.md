# Modified score test

This package implements a modified score test for the parameters in linear mixed effects models with independent random effects.

A brief introduction and an example is available at http://koekvall.github.io/docs/lmmstest/example.html

A paper describing the methods and theory motivating the proposed test is forthcoming.
